# odin-recipes
This project is a website consisting of recipes for Mac and Cheese, Sushi Bakes,
and Smash Burgers. It includes relative links to pages for individual recipes.
In each of those individual pages, there is an image of the food using a
relative image, description of the recipe using the paragraph element,
list of ingredients using an unordered list, and list of steps using an ordered
list.
