        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A homemade Smash Burger is quick and easy to make. These fly off 
            the grill in minutes so it’s a great way to feed a crowd. Smash 
            burgers have the iconic flavor profile of classic Burgers, but 
            that double burger patty with cheese melted in between is 
            irresistible and you’ll love the special sauce.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 soft hamburger roll, buttered and toasted</li>
            <li>Ketchup as desired</li>
            <li>Mayonnaise as desired</li>
            <li>Mustard as desired</li>
            <li>Shredded lettuce as desired</li>
            <li>Onion as desired</li>
            <li>Tomatoes as desired</li>
            <li>Pickles as desired</li>
            <li>4 oz (110g) freshly ground beef chuck, divided into two
                2 oz (55g) balls</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 American or Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare burger bun by laying toppings on bottom half of bun. 
                Have it nearby and ready for when your burger is cooked.</li>
            <li>Preheat a large stainless steel sauté pan or skillet over 
                high heat for 2 minutes. Place balls of beef in pan and smash 
                down with a stiff metal spatula, using a second spatula to 
                add pressure. Smashed patties should be slightly wider than 
                burger bun.</li>
            <li>Season generously with salt and pepper and allow to cook 
                until patties are well browned and tops are beginning to turn 
                pale pink/gray in spots, about 45 seconds. Using a bench 
                scraper or the back side of a stiff metal spatula, carefully 
                scrape patties from pan, making sure to get all of the browned 
                bits.</li>
            <li>Flip patties and immediately place a slice of cheese over 
                1 patty, then stack the second directly on top. Immediately 
                remove from pan and transfer to waiting burger bun. Serve.</li>
        </ol>
