        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Sushi Bake is basically a California roll in casserole form. Layers 
            of rice, seasonings, and fillings get broiled in the oven to make 
            a warm, creamy dish with amazing flavor. The best part about this 
            recipe is that itâ€™s super easy to make and even easier to eat! It 
            tastes better than store-bought sushi rolls because you can 
            customize your own sushi bake with whatever ingredients you have 
            on hand. You can even make it vegetarian by replacing the fish 
            with tofu or vegetables such as carrots or zucchini slices.</p>
